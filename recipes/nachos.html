    <h1>Outrageous Warm Chicken Nacho Dip</h1>
    <img src="../img/nachos.jpg" alt="Nachos covered in cheese sauce and shredded chicken">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my jazzed up version of classic queso dip taken to a heartier level, perfect for football games, tailgating or for taking along to pot lucks in a slow cooker! This is a serious crowd-pleaser that is served hot as a dip, spooned over crisp tortilla chips nacho-style, or rolled up in a warm flour tortilla! The heat can be turned up or down with the addition of jalapenos to taste. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®), drained </li>
        <li>1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food (such as Velveeta®), cubed  </li>
        <li>2 large cooked skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, shredded </li>
        <li>⅓ cup sour cream  </li>
        <li>¼ cup diced green onion  </li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons taco seasoning mix  </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced jalapeno pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup black beans, rinsed and drained </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the diced tomatoes, processed cheese, chicken meat, sour cream, green onion, taco seasoning, and jalapeno pepper into a slow cooker. Cook on High, stirring occasionally until the cheese has melted and the dip is hot, 1 to 2 hours. Stir in the black beans, and cook 15 more minutes to reheat.</li>
    </ol>
